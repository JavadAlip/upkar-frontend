                    He started his career as an LIC agent which gave him an opportunity to develop a deep sense of understanding of the industry. With his diligence and determination, he forayed into the real estate segment. He emerged as a qualified member of the chairman’s club for his quality work. He further strengthened his affiliation towards the real estate segment by taking up distribution of all major brands of cement.

                    In 1974 when Mr. Khan decided set foot in the real estate segment in Bangalore, it was still at its nascent stage. His main aim was to offering quality housing projects at affordable prices. As he established Upkar, he not just focussed to reengineering housing in India, but also laid a strong emphasis on environment management, in order to offer a project that contributed generously to the welfare of the society. With the ongoing support of a dynamic workforce, Upkar is set to take bigger strides in the near future under the leadership of its visionary and chairman.
